The findings aim to guide evidence-based policymaking and foster economic sustainability.

## Key Features:

Data Integration: Merged datasets on labour force characteristics, taxation, wages, and job vacancies for holistic insights.
Regional Analysis: Explored provincial disparities in wages, employment, and income levels.
Age and Gender Trends: Identified wage and tax variations across age groups and gender, highlighting demographic challenges.
Skill Shortage Insights: Examined recruitment strategies and skill gap trends by industry and enterprise size.
Advanced Visualizations: Generated heatmaps, bar plots, and time-series visualizations using Python libraries like matplotlib, seaborn, and pandas.


## Technologies Used:

Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, statsmodels)
SQL for dataset querying and merging
Data cleaning, preprocessing, and integration for complex datasets


## Impact:
